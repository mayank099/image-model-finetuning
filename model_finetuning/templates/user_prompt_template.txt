Here's an analysis of existing descriptions:

Common photo types: {common_photo_types}
Common settings/backgrounds: {common_settings}
Common poses: {common_poses}

Sample descriptions from the dataset:

Based on this analysis, generate {num_prompts} diverse new prompts for generating images.
Each prompt should be different from the others.

Some suggested settings or ideas:
- Distinctive locations or environments
- Different times of day and lighting conditions
- Various moods and atmospheres
- Different styles of photography
- Seasonal variations

Each prompt should be a single detailed sentence that would work well for a text-to-image model.
Label them as "Prompt 1:", "Prompt 2:", etc.
